3. Optional: Add diagnoses, allergies, medications
4. Click "Save"

**Editing a Patient:**
1. Click on patient card
2. Click "Edit" icon
3. Modify fields (all fields editable)
4. Click "Save"

**⚠️ Important:**
- Always verify patient identity using MRN
- Double-check allergies before saving
- Update acuity level as patient condition changes

### Task Management

**Creating a Task:**
1. Open patient detail page
2. Click "Add Task"
3. Select category (medication, lab, imaging, etc.)
4. Set priority and due date
5. Assign to team member
6. Click "Save"

**Task Lifecycle:**
- Pending → In Progress → Completed
- Completed tasks auto-delete after 24 hours
- Critical tasks trigger notifications

**⚠️ Important:**
- Critical tasks require acknowledgment
- Overdue tasks generate alerts
- Review tasks at shift change

### AI Assistant (Clinical Decision Support)

**⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY INFORMATION:**
- All AI suggestions are advisory only
- Never implement AI suggestions without attending physician review
- Not for emergency use
- Document all AI-assisted decisions in patient chart

**Using AI Chat:**
1. Navigate to AI Assistant page
2. **Read the disclaimer banner carefully**
3. (Optional) Select a patient for context
4. Type your clinical question
5. Review AI response
6. **Verify all information with standard references**
7. **Consult attending before acting on suggestions**

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific in your questions
- Include relevant patient context
- Cross-reference with UpToDate, hospital protocols
- Never copy-paste AI text directly into medical records
- If patient selected, AI has access to: demographics, diagnoses, labs, medications, allergies

**Example Good Questions:**
- "What are the differential diagnoses for chest pain in a 65yo with hypertension?"
- "Suggest workup for elevated creatinine in diabetic patient"
- "Drug interactions between warfarin and new antibiotics?"

**Example Poor Questions:**
- "What should I do?" (too vague)
- "Is this patient dying?" (inappropriate for AI)
- "Can I discharge this patient?" (requires clinical judgment)

### Lab Analysis

**Uploading Lab Results:**
1. Take clear photo of lab report or upload PDF
2. Click "Analyze Lab Image"
3. AI extracts values and flags abnormals
4. **Review all extracted values for accuracy**
5. Save to patient record

**⚠️ Important:**
- Always verify AI-extracted values against original lab report
- AI may miss handwritten values
- Critical values require immediate physician notification (don't wait for AI)

### Handover Generation

**Creating Handover Report:**
1. Navigate to Handover page
2. Select ward
3. Click "Generate Handover"
4. AI compiles patient summaries
5. **Review and edit before using**
6. Print or share with incoming team

**⚠️ Important:**
- Review every patient summary for accuracy
- Update with bedside information AI doesn't have
- Don't rely solely on AI-generated handover
